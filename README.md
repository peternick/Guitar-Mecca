# Guitar-Mecca
I created this project over the summer of 2020 to practice using html, css, javascript, and Bootstrap. This is a 
work-in-progress site intended to give certain tools to music enthusiasts. It just so happens that I play guitar 
and mandolin, so I started creating tools related to those first.

<h1>Tuners</h1>

As of now Guitar Mecca provides easy to use tuners for both guitar and mandolin players. These tuners may be 
updated in the future to allow for different tuning styles and other functionalities. Each play button has the 
name of an open string next to it, which corresponds to the string of the respective instrument that is going to 
be strummed. An outline of the string that was played will display based on the button that the user clicks. 
Only one string can be played at a time.

<h1>Chords</h1>
