# Guitar-Mecca

I created this project over the summer of 2020 to practice using html, css, javascript, and Bootstrap. This is a 
work-in-progress site intended to give certain tools to music enthusiasts. It just so happens that I play guitar 
and mandolin, so I started creating tools related to those first.

<h1>Tuners</h1>

As of now Guitar Mecca provides easy to use tuners for both guitar and mandolin players. These tuners may be 
updated in the future to allow for different tuning styles and other functionalities. Each play button has the 
name of an open string next to it, which corresponds to the string of the respective instrument that is going to 
be strummed. An outline of the string that was played will display based on the button that the user clicks. 
Only one string can be played at a time.

<h1>Chords</h1>

Guitar Mecca has a section where users can both listen to and observe chords on guitar or mandolin. Future updates are supposedly
going to include more instruments. There is a visual for each chord in the form of tablature, where each black line (except the left and right most line) in the image of a chord
represents a string and the dot represents where the user needs to put their finger. If the user desires, they can press the play button
to hear what the chord sounds like. 

<h1>Games</h1>

So far there is only one mini-game I have made and it is a quiz-like game where the user must type in the letter of the major chord that is played 
to them through audio. If they guess the correct chord within 5 seconds they will get one point. The maximum amount of points is 20. The letter that
is typed in must be capitalized.
